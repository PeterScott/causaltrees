* Hacking causaltrees
  If you want to hack on causaltrees, this file will provide a really
  unclear summary of what's there and how it works. This is mostly for
  my own reference.

* Weaves
  The core of what causaltrees provides is the Weave5c data type. It's
  made of a FingerWeave (containing the atoms in the document), a
  Quipu (to store the awareness wefts), and a WeftUArray storing the
  rightmost weft of the weave. This is the thing that users should end
  up using. Here are the operations it should provide:

** DONE Make new weave
** DONE Scour: produce Text from weave
** TODO Delete one or more atoms.
   First, make a map from predecessor ids to deletor atoms. Scan
   through linearly, and any time we encounter an atom in the weave
   that produces a map hit, we insert the deletion atom into the
   weave. We can do this by making a weave from a list created by
   interspersing deletion atoms into the list of the weave. If that
   made any sense.
